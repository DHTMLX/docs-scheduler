~~~jsx {}
events?: [
    {
        start_date: Date,
        end_date: Date,
        allDay?: boolean, 
        id?: string | number,
        type?: string | number,
        text?: string,
        details?: string,
        dragResize?: boolean,
        readonly?: boolean,
        dragMove?: boolean,
        recurringEventId?: string | number,
        originalStartTime?: Date,
        status?: string,
        color?: {
            background?: string,
            border?: string,
            textColor?: string
        }, 
        RRULE?: string, 
        STDATE?: Date, 
        DTEND?: Date, 
        recurring?: boolean,
        [custom_key: string]?: any
    }, {...} // other events data
];
~~~

### Parameters

For each *event* you can specify the following parameters (data):

- `start_date` - (required) a start date of the event
- `end_date` - (required) an end date of the event
- `allDay` - (optional) enables/disables the event duration throughout the day

:::note
If the **allDay** parameter is set to *true*, the **start_date** and **end_date** parameters of the event will be ignored!
:::

- `id` - (optional) an ID of the event

:::info
If there are multiple events with the same **id**, the calendar will drop an error as soon as it finds a duplicated **id**. It is expected that each event has its own unique **id**, or that the **id** is not specified (and then the calendar will generate its own **id**).
:::

- `type` - (optional) a type (calendar) of the event
- `text` - (optional) a label of the event
- `details` - (optional) details of the event
- `dragResize` - (optional) enables/disables an ability to resize the event via d-n-d
- `readonly` - (optional) enables/disables an ability to perform all the event's operations
- `dragMove` - (optional) enables/disables an ability to move the event via d-n-d
- `recurringEventId` - (optional) an ID of the original series
- `originalStartTime` - (optional) a time where the event was before changes
- `status` - (optional) a status of event, that was deleted from series. After deleting an event, the status is "cancelled"
- `color` - (optional) an object with the style parameters of the event. Here you can specify the following parameters (styles):
    - `background` - (optional) a HEX code of the event background color
    - `border` - (optional) a HEX code of the event border color
    - `textColor` - (optional) a HEX code of the event text color
- `RRULE` - (optional) a string that defines a rule for a recurring event. You can read more about recurrence rules [here](https://icalendar.org/iCalendar-RFC-5545/3-3-10-recurrence-rule.html)
- `STDATE` - (optional) a start date of the period the event is repeated
- `DTEND` - (optional) an end date of the period the event is repeated
- `recurring` - (optional) enables/disables an ability to repeat the event
- `custom_key` - (optional) a custom key of the event

:::caution
The `STDATE`, `DTEND` and `recurring` fields generated automatically. We don't recommend to change these fields, to avoid unpredictable mistakes
:::

:::info
To set the events data dynamically, you can use the 
[`parse()`](api/methods/js_eventcalendar_parse_method.md) and
[`setConfig()`](api/methods/js_eventcalendar_setconfig_method.md) methods. You can also update the event data using the [`updateEvent()`](api/methods/js_eventcalendar_updateevent_method.md) method.

### Example

~~~jsx {3-27}
// create Event Calendar
new eventCalendar.EventCalendar("#root", {
    events: [
        {
            start_date: new Date("2023-01-27T15:10:00"),
            end_date: new Date("2023-01-27T15:12:00"),
            allDay: false,
            id: "1",
            type: "work",
            text: "Current event",
            details: "Philippe-Chatrier Court\n Paris, FRA",
            dragResize: true,
            readonly: false,
            dragMove: true,
            color: {
                background: "#EDD1EC",
                border: "#AD44AB",
                textColor: "#3e98db"
            },
            RRULE: "FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=1;BYDAY=Mo,Tu,We,Th,Fr",
            recurring: true,
            STDATE: new Date("2023-01-27T15:00:00"),
            DTEND: new Date("2023-06-27T15:00:00"),
            custom_key: "Custom key of the event"
        },
        // other events data
    ] 
    // other configuration parameters
});
